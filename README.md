Unofficial United States general election (2020) timeseries data scraped from archived copies of the NY Times election results webpages.

## Context

On election night (11/03/2020), most Americans went to sleep anticipating a surprising electoral victory for the Republican Party candidate, Donald Trump.  Less than four days later, however, Trump's lead in several key states had evaporated and the news media had crowned his main opponent, the Democrat Party candidate, Joe Biden, the winner.  Not one to give up without a fight, however, Trump and his campaign immediately cried foul, claiming that the late turn in the vote count toward Biden was the result of voter fraud, particularly in the handling of an unprecedented number (owing to the COVID-19 pandemic) of mail-in ballots.  While most Americans probably expect that some small degree of voter fraud occurs in every election, the large-scale and coordinated operation insinuated by the Trump campaign has never been documented.  Nevertheless, many on the right of the political spectrum, convinced that such fraud did occur, are searching for evidence to convince the courts and the public.  Meanwhile, others on the left are working to affirm the legitimacy of the election.

Regardless of one's political leaning, perhaps we can all agree that allegations of voter fraud destroy confidence in our government and that they must be responded to promptly and seriously.  Arguments grounded in hard data, not speculation or prejudice, are needed to determine the facts and fiction regarding voter fraud in the 2020 General Election.  To remedy the paucity of readily accessible election results timeseries data, I have collected detailed vote counts timestamped at numerous intervals on election night and the subsequent days.  The data in these unofficial election results "updates" were originally disseminated by the National Election Pool/Edison Research, databased by the NY Times (among other news agencies), and archived by the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/).  I scraped and compiled the data into several datasets, which can be found in this repository, including 1) county-level timeseries for the presidential race, 2) state-level data for all the general election races (congressional, senatorial, and presidential), and 3) precinct-level detail for GA, FL, MI, NC, and PA (though the data for FL, MI, and PA is only partially complete).  Explore the folders above for details of the various datasets and some useage examples.  Please share widely!
